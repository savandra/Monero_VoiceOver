# Monero_VoiceOver

1
**00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000**
To most people, financial privacy is very important. 

2
**00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000**
But banks, big corporations, and even governments having their records compromised.

3 **00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000**
The undeniable conclusion is there is no safe place to conduct private transactions.

4
**00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000**
Well, there WASNâ€™T one, until now. Meet Monero.

5
**00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000**
Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency. 

6
**00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000**
With Monero, you are your own bank.

7
**00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000**
Only you control and are responsible for your funds

8
**00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000**
Monero is private.

9
**00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000**
This means businesses can keep their suppliers in secret,

10
**00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000**
as well as citizens get rid of government repressions.

11
**00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000**
Monero can also be selectively transparent

12
**00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000**
and you can chose who you want to see the transactions.

13
**00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000**
Monero is dynamically scalable, which makes it very different from a Bitcoin.

14
**00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000**
Also, the block reward will never drop below 0.3 XMR.

15
**00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000**
And the nominal inflation will stay at 0.3 XMR per minute.

16
**00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000**
Monero is decentralized.

17
**00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000**
It has an active development community with more than 30 contributors

18
**00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000**
Join us to build the private finances of tomorrow
